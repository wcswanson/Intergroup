# These are the original files for the Downeast Intergroup Website.
## Times are changing  and devices are changing also.
* This original website has much useful javacode used to display the menues and other features.
* The meeting list is the most important page on this side.
* The meeting list page has about 200 meetings in a html file which was hard to maintain.
* Since there were two different sources for the list the printed list is different from the list on the web.
* Now the web source should now be current and the printed list will be produced from this list.
* The meetling list has been put into a SQL Server database for a central place to hold the lists.
* The one in charge of keeping the list current has the keys to update the database.
* The web master has now lost his job to update the meeting list page ;-).
* The page load speed needs to be improved.
* The meeting list can be exported into a csv (text) file which can be imported into inDesign for printing the list.
* This site is being rewritten to display on devices, to keep the menu consistent on all pages, and to make it easier to
add monthly meeting minutes, financials, and events.
* The web master is trying to design himself out of a job ;-)
